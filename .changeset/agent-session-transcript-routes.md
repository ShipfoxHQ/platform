Adds the lease-authed agent session transcript transport: `GET /runs/jobs/current/steps/:stepId/session` returns the decrypted, still-gzipped head snapshot with manifest headers (or a 204 no-head marker), and `POST .../session?attempt=N&base_segment=S` commits segment `S + 1` under the claim/base CAS with idempotent-retry acks and 409 conflicts. The routes resolve the leased step through a new workflows inter-module method (`getLeasedAgentSessionContext`); the artifact store enforces the session blob cap.
